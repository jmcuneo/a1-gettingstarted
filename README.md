## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**:
  - Styled all (*) with a background, font, & text color
  - Body has a 2% margin to keep text from the edges
  - Did an id style for "blink" & "typewrite" for a css animation & js animation respectively
    - Most of the "typewrite" style is to cover the page & center the button using position, display, z-index, etc.
  - Button uses auto margin top & bottom to center itself & added a solid green border
  - Header & footer are exactly the same to create a big green box
- **JavaScript animation**:
  - Added a script to remove the button & progressively remove the div covering everything
  - This gives a loading effect to the page with the click of a button
- **Other tags used**:
  - Header - To create a message at the top of the page.
  - Footer - To create a message at the bottom of the page.
  - Div - To create a cover to the page for the animation.
  - Button - A button to click
  - A - to link to another page in the middle of a p-tag or li-tag

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Iceburg Font from Google Fonts**: 
  - I used Iceburg font for everything on the site
- **Color Choice**:
  - I did not end up going to color.adobe.com, but I did set the font color with the rgb() value to set it to a specific green.
  - I chose black for the background to keep a specific style for the site.
