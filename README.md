## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added a border rule to the table and td elements; Aligned all text to the center of their respective elements; Split the courses and experience into two divs, set their widths to 45% and floated them to the left and right of the screen; Removed the bullet points from the ul element under the courses; Used margin auto to center the table inside the Div element instead of being off to one side.
- **Added a simple JavaScript animation to the page**: Added a button underneath an image that, when clicked, will expand the image inside its parent div element to 50% of the parent element's width. The functionality was surprisingly hard to get right, as applying this to the outer div instead of the image caused it to look like the image was being fired across the screen, which was not my intention.
- **Other HTML Tags**: Used a table to contain the experience information; Added a short and simple header to the top of the page; Added a figure tag with a video inside of it; To the figure; added a figcaption tag giving an accurate description of the figure above it; Added a short and simple footer to the bottom of the page.

## Design Achievements
- **Used a custom font from Google Fonts**: I used Adamina as the font for all text in my site.
- **Color Wheel/Scheme**: Added a color scheme using color.adobe.com. All 5 colors are utilized, with the header and footer sharing one color, the entire page having a darker background color, the skills and courses sections sharing another color, the initial information at the top having another color, and lastly, the figcaption having its own color.
