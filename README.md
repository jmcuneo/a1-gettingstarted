## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
Added rules for p selector including font-size, opacity, rotation, and font color
Added rule for body selector changing the background color
Added color rules for the footer, h1, and ul selector

(Not sure how this is being counted by my logic was either p, body, footer, h1, ul = 5 OR font-size, opacity, rotation, font color x4, background color = 9)

Added animation for the "Experience" h2 tag to both change color and move across the screen

Added semantic HTML tags:
Header (line 12)
Footer (line 69)
Image (line 48)
And two links (line 47 and 63)

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Whisper Font from Google Fonts**: 
imported using:   
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Whisper&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/whisper-font.css">

- **Color Pallette**: 
I intentionally tried to make a porr color pallette because I thought it would be kind of funny.
