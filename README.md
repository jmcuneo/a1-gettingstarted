Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Glitch
===

This project shows a basic html webpage that Introduces myself. There is some css styling, some javascript animation, and a server.js file that can be run to run the website by opening a terminal and typing "node server.js"

## Technical Achievements
- **1. Styled page with CSS**: Added rules such as a background color for the entire body section, individual rules for elements with individual ids (ex. the "Exp" id has a width, height, padding, background color, a text-align, a transition for the javascript animation, and more).
- **2. Created an animation with Javascript**: Added two event listeners that change the color of an html element when the mouse hovers over it
- **Attempted to manage features with separate git branches**: Used separate branches to work on different features but eventually got lost in the work and did not keep tasks exclusive to their branches
- **3. Used Semantic HTML to label page sections**: used tags such as header, footer, article, image, and section to distinguish between page sections and elements

## Design Achievements
- **1. Used an adobe color palette for good color design**: I created and used an Adobe color palette to create a color theme for my page (lots of blues)
- **2. Used the Swanky and Moo Moo Font from Google Fonts**: I used the google font Swanky and Moo Moo as the font for my introduction.
