## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, h1/2, ul, footer, and various article and image classes. As someone unfamiliar with html, it was challenging to discover what style rules existed and trying to implement them in a reasonably aesthetic manner.
- **Added a simple Animation**: Added a button that toggles the banner of the website between the WPI logo and the Gompei head logo. I initially had issues with this because I had to check whether the "image.src.includes("Banner.png)", as opposed to my assumed method of checking whether "image.src == "Banner.png"" the path to the image.
- **Exerimented with other HTML tags**: Utilized images, articles, links, headers, and footers. This was challening as I had to look into what tags existed as well as when to use them. For example, using headers and footers versus just implementing every section of the page as an article was a distinction I read out about and decided on.

## Design Achievements
- **Used a palette created from Adobe Color**: I used a warmer color palette for my website, with the image for the colour codes in the resources folder. I tried to pick out a reasonably nice palette in warmer, WPI colours. I don't quite like how they blended, so I'll be looking more into colour theory in the future.
- **Used a font from Google Fonts**: I used Courier Prime for the primary text in my site, with Impact as the header font. I've always liked Impact as a font, despite how unprofessional it would be in an academic paper, so I ended up searching Google fonts for a complementary font.
