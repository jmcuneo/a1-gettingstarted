## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, p, ul, h1, h2, article, th, footer, and header selectors. For the body, I added a font and a background color for the webpage. For h1 and article, I added a center text align to center the title and introduction paragraph and added colors to each of these. I added colors to ul, h2, and th to change the color of text for each of these. And I added padding and a background color to make the size and color of the header and footer. I also added a rule for a div I created, email, to set the color and position of my email that I added to the footer.
- **Added to page with semantic HTML tags**: Added a header for the visual effect and a footer to add my email to the page. I also added 2 images with figure captions to show pictures of my cats that I mentioned in my introduction. Finally, I added a table to put the images in so they would be formatted how I wanted.

## Design Achievements
- **Used a color palette to add colors to the webpage**: I created a color palette using color.adobe.com and used the colors to add color to my site using CSS. A screenshot of this color wheel is included in the git repository and is called colorwheel.png.
- **Used the Anybody font from Google Fonts**: I used Anybody as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
