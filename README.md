This project is a basic website where I experimented with using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as with using Node.js, Git/GitHub, and Glitch for web hosting.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the html, body, h1, h2, h3, p, a, ul, li, and footer selectors, as well as some rules for individual elements.
- **Added simple JavaScript animation**: Added script to slowly rotate the WPI logo on the page.
- **Added semantic HTML elements**: Included HTML elements for headers, footers, sections, images, and links. 

## Design Achievements
- **Used color palette**: I used a monochromatic color palette generated using the color wheel tool on color.adobe.com (screenshot of color wheel is color-wheel.png in this repository).
- **Used the ShareTechMono Font from Google Fonts**: I used ShareTechMono as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
