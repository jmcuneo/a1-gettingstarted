# CS 4241 Assignment 1

**William Huang - https://whuang214.github.io/a1-WilliamHuang/**

This project is a simple webpage that introduces myself. It includes a brief description of previous computer science courses I've taken at WPI, some previous professional experiences and software development projects I've worked on. It can be viewed at with [this](https://whuang214.github.io/a1-WilliamHuang/) link.

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Implemented comprehensive CSS rules to enhance the visual layout and usability of the site. Specific achievements include:
  - Customizing typography, including font sizes and colors, to improve readability and visual hierarchy.
  - Implementing a scrollable list for the "Previous Computer Science Courses" section, using #scrollableList with max-height and overflow-y properties. This enhances the user experience by making long lists manageable without overwhelming the page.
  - Adding hover effects to list items (li:hover) and links (a:hover), providing visual feedback that enhances interactivity and engagement.

## Design Achievements

- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: Selected Roboto as the primary typeface for its modern and readable appearance from Google Fonts
- **Thematic Color Palette:** Applied a cohesive color scheme throughout the site, based on a palette of deep blue (#0056b3), light blue (#007bff), light grey (#f8f9fa), dark grey (#343a40), and soft blue (#eef2f7).
