This project shows a basic website displaying information about myself and what I do at WPI. It involved learning basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and implementing many features into it.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
  - Added rules for when the screen is less than 800px width and greater than it. It changes some of the text and images so that it is better seen on each screen size.
  - Added wrapping that allows things to be side by side when the screen is wide enough. This involved using wrappers to allow things to be next to each other. 
  - Added styling to images like adding a border and changing the width based on the screen width.
  - Added styling to the table including colors, borders, and text-format. I also allowed it to stretch out depending on the screen width.
  - Added styling to the header and footer. This involved changing the background color and changing the format of the text.
- **HTML Tags Used**:
  - table: Created a table for my experience
  - URL links using <a> with href="url": Used to link to email, LinkedIn, and resume
  - img: Used to add in a headshot of myself
  - header: Used for the title of the website
  - footer: Used for general information on where to learn more about me
- **JavaScript Animation**: Created a pop up alert that shows before opening up my resume. This allows the user to click ok before opening it or cancel. Also created movement of the WPI logo in the footer when the user is hovering over it. When they stop hovering, it stops the movement.


## Design Achievements
- Create a color palette consisting of 7 accent colors and a white and black that is within the root of my CSS stylesheet.
- Used the Montserrat and Inter Font from Google Fonts: I used Inter as the font for the primary body text and Montserrat for the headers in my site. I created classes for each of these fonts to then call.
