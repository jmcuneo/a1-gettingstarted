## Technical Achievements
CSS Styling
* Various sections have different colors from a color palette. See **Design Achievements** for reference.
* The table uses a different font, which was obtained from Google Fonts.
* Some sections have a box border to separate and define those sections.
* A few text elements have their sizes modified by percent-based values.
* Some elements have their position modified by the margin property as well as the more specific margin-top and margin-left properties.

HTML Tags
* There is an image of a pepperoni pizza on the top of the page. It is associated with the animation component. It was a bit challenging to find the proper syntax for modifying the transform component of elements.
* Near the bottom of the page, there is a table listing shmups that I've cleared or are planning to clear soon.
* There is a hyperlink to my google site in the Education and Experience Section.
* A footer containing a link to the shmup wiki is placed underneath the table title. I did have to spend some time to understand how footers differ from other text elements.
* There is a camouflaged button at the bottom left of the page that reveals a gif and a bit of text. The button hides itself afterwards. It took a bit of research to find how to hide elements properly.

JavaScript Animation
* Utilizing the image listed in HTML Tags, I made a simple script that rotates the pizza constantly. 
* The main challenge was hooking up the script to activate on the page loading. Generally, it seems some of the methods used for this are deprecated so I wanted to find something that was guarenteed to work properly.

## Design Achievements
