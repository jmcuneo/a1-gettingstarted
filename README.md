## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 1. Box-Sizing: I created sectioned boxes to seperate text blocks and included elements like margins. 2. Body Fonts: I changed the font style, font color, and the background color of text. 3. Backgrounds: I applied a consistent style to elements like footers and asides to make them stand out more from the base background. 4. Headers: I colored the headers differently than other elements to make them stand out and enhance readability. 5. Links decoration: I changed the colors of hyperlinks to be subtly different so you're more inclined to click on them and make them more distinct from normal text.
- **Added a simple javascript animation**: I added an animation that transitions the background color of a line of text to red using a javascript animation.
- **Experimented with semantic HTML tags**: 1. 'header'; used as a main heading for the page to introduce the point and purpose of the webpage. 2. 'section' used to divide the webpage into different sections to enhance readability and make the format of the page more structured. 3. 'aside' used as a supplementary labeling tag, similar 'header', but for smaller-scale subjects that are sub-sections of the main webpage. 4. 'body' used as a container for all the webpage content, including other tags like 'header'. 5. 'script' used to implement the javascript elements inside an HTML file, which is how I was able to implement my color-change animation.

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Oxygen Font from Google Fonts**: I used Oxygen as a font for my website.
- **Used the Adobe color palette tool** I used Adobe to create a color palette of yellow and orange.
