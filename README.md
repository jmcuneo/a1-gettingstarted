This project shows an overview of my classes and work at WPI. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added styling rules for html header, footer, body, table, th, td, a. I styled the header and footer to have a background, centered text, padding, and custom font color. I then set the color of the link and changed the max width of the body to 1000px with a auto-margin to align it to the middle. I also changed the color of the default text in the html to an off-black.

- **Added animation with JS**: I added a spin animation when clicking on the WPI logo.

- **Experiment with other semantic HTML tags**: I added the link, image, table, header, and footer tags.

## Design Achievements
- **Used a color palette from Adobe**: I used 5 colors from a palette on Adobe throughout the webpage. The off-black is the primary text color. Blue is in the header and footer. The off-brown is the text color in the header and footer. The border of the table is grey. And the color of links is orange. 

- **Used the Inter Font from Google Fonts**: I used the Inter font from Google fonts as the primary font for the html tag.
