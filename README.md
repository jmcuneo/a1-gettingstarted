This project demonstrates the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specificially, in developing my "portfolio" I demonstrated technical skills in using sematnic HTML to develop a responsive website, multiple styling tactics with CSS, as well as using JavaScript for simple interactivity.

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Added the following rules:
  - Dashed underlines for Course ID's
  - 50px auto margin on body content
  - Padding 0 10px on body content
  - Max-width: 600px on body content
  - Line-height: 2 on body content
  - Float: left (for course names)
  - Aside: italic font, weight 300
- **Add a simple Javascript animation**: Completed this design achievement by creating a button that toggles light/dark mode on the page.
- **Experiment with semantic HTML**
  - x2 links
  - A header
  - 3 sections
  - A table (for courses)
  - An aside (for the Alan Watts quote)

## Design Achievements

- **Used the Ubuntu from Google Fonts**: The entire website is styled using the Ubuntu font provided from Google Fonts. I use Ubuntu Regular (except for the aside, which is Ubuntu Light, Italics)
- **Used a color pallete from Adobe Colors:** I achieved this design achievement by styling my page using a color pallete from Adobe Colors. I used all six colors - and while it is not the most pretty looking combination of colors - it does achieve the design goal!
