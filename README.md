- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for body by making the default text poppins, and the default color the gray from the color wheel. Also added rules to remove the margin from the body. Added rules for the nav to give it a height and a background color. Added rules for the nav text to make it the dark color of the color wheel. Added rules to the div to give the page content margins. Added rules to the headers to change their colors to a darker color in the color wheel
