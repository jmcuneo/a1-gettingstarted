## Design Achievements

- **Used the Ubuntu from Google Fonts**: The entire website is styled using the Ubuntu font provided from Google Fonts. I use Ubuntu Regular.
- **Used a color pallete from Adobe Colors:** I achieved this design achievement by styling my page using a color pallete from Adobe Colors. I used all six colors - and while it is not the most pretty looking combination of colors - it does achieve the design goal!
