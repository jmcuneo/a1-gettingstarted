Technical Achievement

Style your page using CSS:
1. I created classes to style the things easier. Most of the classes had rules such as padding, margin, and max height. The "fadeImage" class uses display none and block. I also used align-items, justify-content, and float.
2. I added rules to header, h1, h2, h4, p, u1, footer to change color, font-family, font-size, boarder, text-shadow, margin, and padding. For font-size, I used vw to have it relative to the viewport size. 
The most complicated styling was h1:

```
h1 {
    margin: 0;
    color: #40F5B1;
    font-family: "Rock 3D";
    font-size: 3vw;
    border: 10px dotted pink;
    text-shadow: 0 0 10px skyblue, 0 0 5px violet;
    width: fit-content;
}
```

JavaScript animation

My JavaScript animation has the user attempt to wake up the sleeping boy. The sleeping boy will resist, so the user will have to be persistent and click the button multiple times. Then, he will wake up. The user then can put him to sleep, resetting the animation.

Experiment with other semantic HTML tags

Other semantic HTML tags I used were \<a href>, \<aside>, \<img>, \<header>, \<footer>, \<div>, \<article>, \<script>, \<button>, and \<h4>
