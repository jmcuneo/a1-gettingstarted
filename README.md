This project shows a website that includes my name, major and some facts about myself. It also features the CS courses that I have taken here at WPI and the expirence I have with various CS techonolgies.

**Technical Achievements**
1. (5 points) Style your page using CSS. Each style rule you apply will get you 1 point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe your style rules in your README.
    1) I used bolding for the text in my personal facts and major section along with the course IDs for my WPI courses I have taken. This makes them more defined an readable
    2) I also used italics for the Experience Scale in my CS Technologies section. Also it is used for my B.S. and Minor in my Header and Major section. This puts special emphasis on important unique components of the web page
    3) I used the center align for the Header 1s in my webiste and for my Bio and major section. This puts the most important information front-and-center for the reader.
    4) I gave the table for my CS techonolgies section a border or 1px to make it more readable. This gives a different approach from the list view that my course experience section has. It is a more intuitive way to format the number rating system for my CS Technologiy experiences.
    5) I gave my header and footer sections unique font sizes and padding for a color sperate from the background color for the website. This helps differentiate my header an foot from the rest of the web page.

2. (5 points) Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page.
    1) My simple animation is a color changing script within my HTML which changes the color of the text for "Worcester Polytechnic Institute" above the image. The text cycles the color wheel. This taught me how to use the .getElementsById() extension to access objects with IDs.

3. (5 points) Experiment with other *semantic* HTML tags (links, images, tables, header, footer, etc.). Each extra tag you use will get you 1 point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe the tags you use in your README.
    1) I made a header that includes a title and relevant major info to learn how to make a header and use css to format it.
    2) I made a footer with an author attribution to learn how to make a footer and use css to format it.
    3) Also, within my footer there is a link to my Github account to learn how to embed a link within a website.
    4) I included an image of WPI under my CS technologies section to test how to import an image. I took this picture as a first year student called wpi.png in my repo.
    5) I created a table for my CS technologies experience to understand how tables are structured in HTML.

**Design Achievements**
1. (10 points) Create a color palette using [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com). Use all the colors in the palette in your webpage by implementing the appropriate CSS. Add a small screenshot of the color wheel for your color palette to your repo.
    1) I used a color pallette from Adobe and I have included a adobe_colors.png in my repo. Though, for reference my colors are:
        Color 1: #348888
        Color 2: #22BABB
        Color 3: #9EF8EE
        Color 4: #FA7F08
        Color 5: #F24405

2. (5 points) Use a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) in your website.
    1) I used the font "Madimi One" from Google fonts for the entire web page.
        https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Madimi+One
