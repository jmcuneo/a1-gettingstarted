## Design Achievements
- **Used the Color Wheel from Adobe**: I used colors from the color palette generated by setting the color wheel using the Adobe tool.
  - I set the color wheel to get mixed shades of blue and green and the following were the CSS color codes generated: 
    - #61F2A7
    - #61DCF2
    - #61F2D8
    - #61F274
    - #61AEF2
    - #00F5C8
  - I added these colors using the CSS property: background for various aspects such as the table, footer, welcome text, and buttons. 
  - The color wheel and palette images are attached in the repository 
- **Used the Nunito Sans Font from Google Fonts**: I used Nunito Sans as the font for the entire body/content in my site.
  - I imported the font into CSS file using @import url and applied the font-family property to the entire body tag.
