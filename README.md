## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the h1, h2, body, footer, table, th, and td selectors. This included changing background colors, text alignment, padding, font styles, and borders. 
- **Added JavaScript Animation**: Added a fade-in and fade out for the image of me when hovered over. When the mouse hovers over the image, it should fade to 0% capacity. Then, when the mouse leaves the image, the image should return. 
- **Experiemented with semantic HTML tags**: Added a footer, an image, a link, a table, and a header. 

## Design Achievements
- **Used a color palette from color.adobe.com**: I created and used a 3-color palette on color.adobe.com. Please refer to color_palette.png in this repo to see exact color palette. 
- **Used the Elsie Font from Google Fonts**: I used Elsie as the font for the headers in my site.
