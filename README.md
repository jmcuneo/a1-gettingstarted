## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, li, a, h1, h2, body, and main selectors. 
- **Added simple JavaScripts animation**: Nyan cat goes across the top of the page. Code is in scripts.js. This one took a bit because I wasn't familiar with using JavaScript and HTML together.
- **Added semantic HTML tags**: Added footer, image, links, blockquote, main, h1, and h2

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Madimi One Font from Google Fonts**: Linked at the top of index.html, and in the body selector in styles.css
- **Used color palatte from Adobe**: Screenshot is on the website
