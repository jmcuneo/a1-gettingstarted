## Design Achievements
### Color Palette Implementation
I created a unique color palette using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com). This palette was then implemented throughout my website to maintain a consistent and visually appealing design. Each color from the palette has been applied to various elements on the webpage to ensure that the overall design is cohesive. The palette is utilized in the following ways:

- **Background Color**: The lightest color in the palette is used as the background color for the entire webpage, providing a subtle, neutral backdrop that makes the content stand out.
- **Text Color**: The darkest color from the palette is used for the main body text, offering maximum contrast against the light background for readability.
- **Headers**: A vibrant color from the palette highlights the header elements, drawing attention to the page's main sections.
- **List Items**: Alternating colors from the palette are used for list item backgrounds to create a visually engaging pattern that also aids in content organization.

A small screenshot of the color wheel from my Adobe Color palette is included in the repository to demonstrate the color scheme visually.

- **Montserrat Font**: Imported via the Google Fonts API, this font is applied to the `h1` header element, adding a modern and clean aesthetic to the titles on the webpage. It was chosen for its geometric accuracy and contemporary character, which enhances the site's overall professional look.
