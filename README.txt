CSS StyleSheet Rules (each bullet is what I counted as a rule):

- I added a bunch of rules to buttons, so they came out nicely (I'm counting this as one rule personally)
- <p> has font size set to 15px for anything contained inside
- <body> has the background set to a color from the color palette
- <a> has a larger font size and is opaque
- <header> has a small font size and its own background

Animation:

- Clicking on the button causes the gif to rotate, clicking again will stop the rotation


Other HTML Tags used:

- <Button>: Used to interact with the image along with a script embed in the HTML file
- <IMG>: (No the GIF is not my animation, and I am aware of that, I just I like the club penguin dance gif), also yet another filetype to need to be mentioned in the server.js file
- <a>: Complete with a href link to lead to the repo for this project
- <header>: simply some text on the top of the page
- <script>: writing code in an embed (used for the button)

Design Achievements:

- color_palette_screenshot.png is the requested screenshot of the color palette used (In the CSS file, these were saved as varibles as well)
- I used the rubik font family for all text on my page (found on google fonts per requested) and implemented via class
