        <p>Introduction to Program Design (A22) - Dr. Racket</p>
          <blockquote>
            This course introduces principles of computation and programming
            with an emphasis on program design. Topics include the design,
            implementation, and testing of programs that use a variety of data
            structures (such as structures, lists, and trees), functions,
            conditionals, recursion, and higher-order functions.

        <p>Object-Orieted Design (B22) - Java</p>
        <blockquote>
        This course shows how programs can be decomposed into classes and objects.
        By emphasizing design, this course shows how to implement small defect-free programs
        and evaluate design decisions to select an optimal design under specific assumptions.
        Topics include inheritance, exceptions, interface, design by contract, basic design patterns, and reuse.
        Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug object-oriented programs composed of multiple classes
        and over a variety of data structures.

        <p>Systems Programing Concepts (C23) - C/C++</p>
        <blockquote>
          This course covers manual memory management, pointers, the machine stack, and input/ output mechanisms.
          The course will involve large-scale programming exercises and will be designed to help students confront
          issues of safe programming with system-level constructs. The course will cover several tools that assist programmers
          in these tasks. Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug programs in C++ and C.

        <p>Algorithms (D23) - Java</p>
        <blockquote>
          Building on a fundamental knowledge of data structures, data abstraction techniques, and mathematical tools,
          a number of examples of algorithm design and analysis worst case and average case will be developed.
          Topics include greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, heuristics, and probabilistic algorithms.
          Problems will be drawn from areas such as sorting, graph theory, and string processing.

        <p>Foundations of Computer Science (A23)</p>
        <blockquote>
          This course introduces the theoretical foundations of computer science.
          These form the basis for a more complete understanding of, and proficiency in computer science.
          Topics include computational models, formal languages, and an introduction to computability and complexity theory,
          including NP-completeness.

        <p>Introduction To Machine Organization And Assembly Language (B23)</p>
        <blockquote>
          This course introduces students to the structure and behavior of modern digital computers and the way they execute programs.
          Machine organization topics include the von Neumann model of execution, functional organization of computer hardware,
          the memory hierarchy, caching performance, and pipelining. Assembly language topics include representations of numbers in
          computers, basic instruction sets, addressing modes, stacks and procedures, low-level I/O, and the functions of compilers,
          assemblers, linkers, and loaders.

        <p>Operating Systems (C24) - C</p>
        <blockquote>
          This course provides the student with an understanding of the basic components of a general-purpose operating system.
          Topics include processes, process management, synchronization, input/output devices and their programming, interrupts,
          memory management, resource allocation, and an introduction to file systems. Students will be expected to design and implement a
          large piece of system software in the C programming language.
