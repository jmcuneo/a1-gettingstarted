    <h1>Information about Lucas Sicard</h1>
    <p>
      I am a current student at WPI & a Fullstack Engineer at <a href="https://www.croi.io/">Croi Inc.</a> I graduated
      from Quinsigamond Community College in 2022 with high honors in CS Transfer. I was a part of PTK at QCC during my
      time there & was the treasurer for a time which earned me a scholarship for WPI. I also graduated from Maynard High
      School in Maynard, MA in 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have worked on many projects & taken many CS courses over the years; In my senior year of high school, I
      self-taught C++ & built a video game demo without the use of a game engine. At QCC I learned mainly C++, TDD, &
      other useful CS skills. My final project at QCC, I worked on a website to help QCC students learn C++ using block
      coding. At WPI I joined Engineers Without Borders (EWB) & became their Webmaster further improving my web
      development skills. WPI also helped me find my current job, Croi, where I currently work with React to maintain &
      build their website. I also just completed my MQP which is on <a href="https://sleepwebapp.wpi.edu/">sleep health</a>
      where I helped to develop a website using React. I also am currently working on another website that is not up yet
      for Professor Ruiz & Professor Ryder at WPI. As you can see, I have lots of experience with programming &ndash;
      mainly in C++, Java, & JavaScript/TypeScript with a little bit of Python &ndash; & have taken many CS courses at
      both of my colleges.
