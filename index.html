    <h2 style="color:#331620">Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Working experience: I have a lot of experience in web development, and my experience in the following areas
      includes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>HTML</b> - I have a lot of experience with HTML. I first learned HTML at my first internship 2 years ago.
        I prefer to style div elements, rather than use built-in html tags in order to eliminate using unwanted
        CSS properties. My favorite markup language is SSML!
      </li>
      <li><b>CSS</b> - I have an abundance of experience in CSS and in responsive development. I love to use CSS
        libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind. Rem > px!</li>
      <li><b>Java</b> - Java was the first programming language that I have ever learned! Although I have not touched
        it since CS2103. I am sure that it will come back to me, though I have never used Java in a web development
        setting</li>
      <li><b>JavaScript</b> - This is my favorite language! I am very well versed in JavaScript. My favorite libraries
        are
        Chart.js, Sequelize, Axios, and JQuery. I am also an experienced React developer, and I have a good amount
        of experience in React Native and TypeScript
      </li>
      <li><b>Python</b> - I haven't done the most advanced coding in Python, however I know a lot about this language. I
        have published a cybersecurity Alexa Skill, written entirely in Python! I haven't used python in a web
        development setting, but I am excited to learn more!</li>
      <li><b>Unit Testing</b> - I have used JUnit testing, but that is about it. At my first intership, my boss told me
        that unit testing is a waste of time that you could spend developing new things! Whether he was right or
        wrong, I would like to learn more about unit testing.
      </li>
      <li><b>Refactoring Code</b> - At my first internship, I was assigned to fix the code on a React website that a
        previous
        employee built. The website was a mess! So I made it resopnsive and clean. My experience refoactoring code
        is web projects is top-notch!
