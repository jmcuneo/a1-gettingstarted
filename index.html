        <div class="myInfo">
          <p id="intro">
            Hello, my name is Lucca Chantre. I am from Waltham, MA, and my
            family is Brazilian. In A term I went on IQP in Zurich Switzerland
            and I loved it! Two very important things to know about me are that
            I have a stutter (please be patient with me) and that I love music.
            I play (jazz) piano, bass, drums, some saxophone, and I produce
            music through a digital audio workstation software called FL Studio.
            My favorite artist at the moment is Carrtoons.
