    <h1>Information about Joshua Cuneo</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a transplanted San Francisco hippie who's found his way to New England through Georgia. My interests are in digital media, programming, scientific computing, space exploration, green technology, and the interdisciplinary uses of computing. When not teaching, I enjoy computer programming, reading, creative writing, video production, astronomy, hiking, traveling, and science fiction, among other interests. I also volunteer with FIRST Lego League and with the videography staff at DragonCon in Atlanta. I'm an avid Star Trek fan, but I usually leave my Vulcan ears at home. Iâ€™m always happy to discuss computers or any other topic of interest with students during non-class hours.
