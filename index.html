    <h1>Information about Lucca Chantre, class of 2025</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Lucca Chantre. I am from Waltham, MA, and my family is Brazilian. In A term I went on IQP in Zurich Switzerland and I loved it!
       Two very important things to know about me are that I have a stutter (please be patient with me) and that I love music. 
      I play (jazz) piano, bass, drums, some saxophone, and I produce music through a digital audio workstation software called FL Studio. 
      My favorite artist at the moment is Carrtoons.
