        <h1>Information about Sai Teja Sunku</h1> <!-- heading -->
        <p> <!-- paragraph form to write about me -->
            I am Sai Teja majoring in Computer Science and a current Sophomore at WPI.
            Studied the International Baccalaureate Diploma program in my high school.
            My passion for computer science started, when I was in high school and my journey towards this field starts through online courses.
            While I learned new topics in computer science, I began to code simultaneously to practice my learnings.
            While coding, I also learnt the skill of debugging.
            I always enjoy researching as it gives me the opportunity to learn and explore my interests in computer science.
            Especially, I am fascinated to code in python and learn and implement AI and Machine Learning techniques.
            I like to explore different algorithms and implement various data structures, which are the skills I believe are important.
            I also like working with my friends on different programming projects and participate in hackathons with them by developing creative and innovative solutions.
            Apart from programming, I like to watch movies, hangout with friends, and explore new places.
