    <h1>Information about Nicholas Whalen 2024</h1>
    <p>
      I am a senior at WPI studying computer science.<br>
      Outside of school, I am very passionate about pursuing my hobbies and interests. My favorite hobby is music. I am primarily a vocalist, but I am also
      learning guitar and songwriting.<br>
      My other hobbies include playing video games, surfing during the summer (or whenever I can, if I am lucky enough to travel), and snowboarding during the winter.


    </p>
    <p>
      I am studying computer science at WPI, and I am primarily interested in the design route, especially software engineering. I intend to graduate in May 2024 with a BS in computer science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my favorite classes at WPI have been Software Engineering, Human Computer Interaction, and Databases I and II.<br>
      Although I do not have a ton of experience with web development languages and concepts, I am very excited to learn and improve my full stack development skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
      <li>HTML - I am somewhat comfortable with HTML, I do not have much experience with it outside my HCI class, but it has been very straightforward to me whenever I have needed to learn about it. </li>
      <li>CSS - Similar to HTML, I have seen some people on youtube who are wizards with CSS, and I cannot do anything crazy, but I understand the basic concepts.</li>
      <li>JAVA - I am very comfortable using Java, it is the language I have used the most during my time at WPI, and my preferred programming language.</li>
      <li>JavaScript - I have very little experience with JavaScript, I am currently learning it from the textbooks in this course. Improving my JS skills will be a focus for me throughout this course.</li>
      <li>Python - I am comfortable with Python, I have typically used it in projects where I am primarily working with collecting, reading, and manipulating data.</li>
      <li>Unit Testing - I am very experienced with unit testing, it is a habit that I formed as a freshmen in 2102, and have always been a fan of it.</li>
      <li>Refactoring Code - I took a course in B-term where the main focus of the class was Test-Driven Development. In this course, refactoring and unit testing were the main focuses, and I got plenty of practice with both.</li>
    </ul>
